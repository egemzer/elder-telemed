This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a rough draft of the front-end for the Telemedicine For The
Elderly.  It does not yet connect to Firebase and therefore it cannot
yet set up a conversation.  All you can do is press the "Login" button
and admire yourself in the mirror.

### `npm i`

To install all the little bits.
